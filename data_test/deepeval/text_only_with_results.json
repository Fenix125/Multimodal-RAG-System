      ". Communities do have concerns about data centers beyond the general dislike of AI; I will address this in a later letter. Populist anger against AI raises the risk that laws will be passed that hamper AI development. To be clear, all of us working in AI should look carefully at both the benefits and harmful effects of AI (such as deepfakes polluting social media and biased or inaccurate AI outputs misleading users), speak truthfully about both benefits and harms, and work to ameliorate problems even as we work to grow the benefits. But hype about AI’s danger has done real damage to trust in our field. Much of this hype has come from leading AI companies that aim to make their technology seem extraordinarily powerful by, say, comparing it to nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, a significant fraction of the public has taken this seriously and thinks AI could bring about the end of the world. The AI community has to stop self-inflicting these wounds and work to win back society’s trust",
      ". The AI community has to stop self-inflicting these wounds and work to win back society’s trust. Where do we go from here? First, to win people’s trust, we have a lot of work ahead to make sure AI broadly benefits everyone. “Higher productivity” is often viewed by general audiences as a codeword for “my boss will make more money,” or worse, layoffs. As amazing as ChatGPT is, we still have a lot of work to do to build applications that make an even bigger positive impact on people’s lives. I believe providing training to people will be a key piece of the puzzle. DeepLearning.AI will continue to lead the charge on AI training, but we will need more than this. Second, we have to be genuinely worthy of trust. This means every one of us has to avoid hyping things up or fear mongering, despite the occasional temptation to do so for publicity or to lobby governments to pass laws that stymie competing products (such as open source). I hope our community can also call out journalism that spreads hype",

At the same time, I recognize that AI does have problems, and the AI community needs to address them. I frequently speak with people from many different walks of life. I’ve spoken with artists concerned about AI devaluing their work, college seniors worried about the tough job market and whether AI is exacerbating their challenges, and parents worried about their kids being addicted to, and receiving harmful advice from, chatbots. I don’t know how to solve all of these problems, but I will work hard to solve as many as I can. And I hope you will too. It will only be through all of us doing this that we can win back society’s trust. Keep building! Andrew",

Despite the AI community’s optimism about the tremendous benefits AI will bring, we should take this seriously and not dismiss it. The public’s concerns about AI can be a significant drag on progress, and we can do a lot to address them. According to Edelman’s survey, in the U.S., 49% of people reject the growing use of AI, and 17% embrace it. In China, 10% reject it and 54% embrace it. Pew’s data also shows many other nations much more enthusiastic than the U.S. about AI adoption. Positive sentiment toward AI is a huge national advantage. On the other hand, widespread distrust of AI means: Individuals will be slow to adopt it"

      "In factories, where teams of robotic arms work in tight spaces, their motions are programmed by hand to keep them from interfering with one another. Researchers automated this programming using graph neural networks trained via reinforcement learning. What’s new: Matthew Lai, Keegan Go, and colleagues at Google DeepMind, University College London, and robotics software shop Intrinsic developed RoboBallet , a graph neural network that coordinates robotic arms. Key insight: Coordinating several robot arms is computationally infeasible for traditional search-based planners that figure out how to reach a target by searching through possible joint movements while checking for collisions. Each additional robot or obstacle multiplies the number of possible configurations. A graph neural network can overcome this limitation by learning to produce synchronized, collision-free motions in large numbers of simulated setups with different robot placements, obstacles, and target positions",
      ". In addition, the model is more robust. When a robot fails, hard-coded routines can’t adapt. By contrast, the graph neural network continuously tracks how robots, tasks, and obstacles relate. If a robot fails, it can adapt on the fly and revise its plan. We’re thinking: Representing the world as a graph enforces a built-in structure to the data, tracking relative positions and relationships between objects. Other data structures don’t inherently provide relationships between objects, so a network learning from them would have to learn those relationships as well. Using a graph makes it easier for a network to learn how to perform a task, since it doesn’t need to learn those relationships.",

A graph neural network can overcome this limitation by learning to produce synchronized, collision-free motions in large numbers of simulated setups with different robot placements, obstacles, and target positions. How it works: RoboBallet is a graph neural network that takes as input positions and orientations of robots, obstacles, and targets and generates joint velocities for each arm from its current position to reach a target. The authors trained it entirely in simulation using the TD3 actor-critic algorithm , a reinforcement learning algorithm. They generated about 1 million simulated workspaces, each of which contained a team of 4 or 8 simulated 3-joint Franka Panda robotic arms attached to the sides of a table at random, 30 obstacle blocks placed at random, and 40 target positions/orientations per team. They rejected configurations that started in collision. Given a workspace, the authors represented robots, obstacles, and target positions as nodes in a graph",

The authors started with 24.3 million robot demonstrations of tasks such as “pick up the water bottle from the drawer and put it on the desk.” Each example included a text instruction, camera views, and changes in joint positions. The authors augmented the examples with depth maps and motion paths.They generated the depth maps using a pretrained Depth Anything 2 , and they produced visual paths by tracking the robot arm’s gripper in the camera images using Molmo , a pretrained vision-language model. They trained Qwen2.5-7B on the augmented dataset. Given a text instruction and camera image, the model learned to generate tokens that represented, in this order, (i) a depth map, (ii) a visual path, and (iii) changes in joint positions. To improve the system’s vision-language understanding, they further pretrained both models on 2 million examples of images and text scraped from the web",

Having multiple agents run in parallel is growing as a technique to further scale and improve performance. We know from work at Baidu by my former team, and later OpenAI, that AI models’ performance scales predictably with the amount of data and training computation. Performance rises further with test-time compute such as in agentic workflows and in reasoning models that think, reflect, and iterate on an answer. But these methods take longer to produce output. Agents working in parallel offer another path to improve results, without making users wait. Reasoning models generate tokens sequentially and can take a long time to run.

In the last example, when pressed, the agent apologized and agreed “that was an incredibly stupid mistake.” This made us feel better, but the damage had already been done! I love coding agents despite such mistakes and see them making us dramatically more productive. To make them more reliable, I’ve found that prioritizing where to test helps. I rarely write (or direct an agent to write) extensive tests for front-end code. If there's a bug, hopefully it will be easy to see and also cause little lasting damage. For example, I find generated code’s front-end bugs, say in the display of information on a web page, relatively easy to find"

( GitHub ) OpenAI and ROOST release open-weight safety models OpenAI launched gpt-oss-safeguard in two sizes (120 billion and 20 billion parameters) as open-weight models under an Apache 2.0 license. The models use chain-of-thought reasoning to classify content according to developer-provided policies at inference time, eliminating the need to retrain classifiers when policies change. OpenAI developed the approach internally as “Safety Reasoner,” which now accounts for up to 16 percent of total compute in some recent launches. The models outperformed GPT-5 Thinking on internal multi-policy accuracy tests despite their smaller size. Both models are available now on Hugging Face",
      ". ( Anthropic ) New leaderboard benchmarks speech recognition systems Researchers at Hugging Face launched the Open ASR Leaderboard, a reproducible benchmark that evaluates over 60 open-source and proprietary automatic speech recognition systems across 11 datasets, including multilingual transcription and long-form audio. The benchmark reports both word error rate (WER) and inverse real-time factor (RTFx), enabling fair comparisons of both accuracy and processing speed. For English transcription, conformer encoders paired with large language model decoders achieved the best average WER but processed audio more slowly, while CTC and TDT decoders delivered significantly better speed — up to 6,400 times faster than real-time — making them more practical for long-form and offline transcription. Nvidia’s open Canary and Parakeet models top the leaderboard for accuracy and speed respectively; surprisingly, proprietary models tend to trail open models on both benchmarks",

    "query": "How is AI being used to optimize energy use in data centers, and what do we know about the energy footprint of large models?",
    "expected_answer": "Recent studies from major cloud providers directly measure the electricity use, water consumption, and greenhouse gas emissions associated with training and running large models. The results show that AI workloads are a growing share of data center energy demand, though their impact varies by region and infrastructure. At the same time, AI is being applied to optimize cooling, scheduling, and workload placement in data centers, often yielding significant energy savings. Policy analyses, such as those by the International Energy Agency, stress that both efficiency gains and the sheer growth in AI demand must be considered when projecting the sector’s long-term climate impact.",
    "llm_output": "AI is being leveraged to optimize energy use in data centers through various strategies, including the development of more efficient AI models and hardware, improved cooling methods, and the adoption of renewable energy sources. However, the energy footprint of large AI models remains a significant concern, with projections indicating increasing energy consumption as models grow in size and usage.\n\nHere are some key insights from recent articles:\n\n*   **Mistral Measures LLM Consumption of Energy, Water, and Materials** (August 27, 2025): A French AI startup, Mistral, has disclosed the full lifecycle consumption and emissions for its large language model, Mistral Large 2. This initiative aims to provide transparency for comparing models, fostering environmentally friendly AI, and potentially reducing overall impacts. Data centers and cloud computing account for 1 percent of global energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, and while this is a relatively small percentage, understanding AI's resource consumption is crucial for effective management as demand rises. The environmental footprint of new AI models and processors is steadily decreasing.\n*   **AI Uses Energy, AI Saves Energy** (June 4, 2025): The International Energy Agency (IEA) has examined the energy costs and potential savings associated with the AI boom. While AI is poised to consume vast amounts of energy, efforts to reduce energy costs through more efficient models, hardware (e.g., energy-efficient chips, improved cooling), and usage patterns (e.g., batch processing, running smaller models locally) are expected to lead to a decrease in energy consumption for training, inference, and cooling. However, the Jevons paradox suggests that lower energy costs for AI could lead to even greater overall consumption. Many AI and cloud-computing companies are securing long-term agreements for renewable and zero-emissions energy, primarily solar, to power their data centers.\n*   **Reasoning Boosts Carbon Emissions** (August 6, 2025): Researchers have confirmed that reasoning models that generate more tokens have a larger environmental footprint. The IEA projects that AI will consume increasing amounts of energy, leading to more greenhouse gas emissions, as companies focus on training and serving larger models. There's a direct correlation: more accurate model output often means more emissions and increased user queries. While older GPUs are less energy-efficient, much cloud computing now occurs in data centers powered by renewable energy sources. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Meta are actively matching or powering their data centers with renewable energy.",

      ". If it’s widely adopted, it could help researchers, businesses, and users compare different models, work toward more environmentally friendly AI, and potentially reduce overall impacts. We’re thinking: Data centers and cloud computing are responsible for 1 percent of the world’s energy-related greenhouse gas emissions, according to the International Energy Agency. That’s a drop in the bucket compared to agriculture, construction, or transportation. Nonetheless, having a clear picture of AI’s consumption of resources can help us manage them more effectively as demand rises. It's heartening that major AI companies are committed to using and developing sustainable energy sources and using them efficiently, and the environmental footprint of new AI models and processors is falling steadily.",
      ". Yes, but: The authors concede that lower energy costs for AI likely will lead to much greater consumption — according to the Jevons paradox — so more-efficient models and hardware will result in higher energy consumption overall. Behind the news: Data centers were growing rapidly prior to the boom in generative AI. Data centers’ electricity use doubled between 2000 and 2005 and again between 2017 and 2022, driven by the growth of cloud computing and data storage, streaming and social media, and cryptocurrency mining. However, these periods of accelerating growth were followed by periods of slower growth as efforts to cut costs led to more-efficient software and hardware. The authors expect this pattern to hold. Why it matters: The IEA report is a first-of-its-kind analysis of AI’s energy requirements, how they’re likely to grow, as well as the potential of the technology itself to reduce those requirements. It confirms that AI is poised to consume huge amounts of energy",
      ". AI and cloud-computing companies continue to negotiate long-term purchase agreements that can secure renewable and zero-emissions energy for as much as 20 years. Data center operators are responsible for most of the long-term contracts that have been announced, nearly all of them for solar energy. Consequently, renewables generation is projected to grow by over 450 TWh by 2035. The energy costs of training, inference, and cooling hardware are expected to fall further thanks to trends in AI models (fewer parameters, more efficient algorithms, task-specific models) hardware (more energy-efficient chips, improved cooling methods), and usage (batch processing, running smaller models locally rather than in the cloud). Yes, but: The authors concede that lower energy costs for AI likely will lead to much greater consumption — according to the Jevons paradox — so more-efficient models and hardware will result in higher energy consumption overall",
      ". Yes, but: The authors’ estimates of carbon emissions likely are overestimates. Older GPUs such as the A100 are less energy-efficient than newer ones; and much cloud computing takes place in data centers powered by renewable energy sources that emit less carbon than global average energy consumption. For example, Google and Amazon match their electricity consumption with renewable energy, and Meta has powered its data centers solely by renewable energy since 2020. Why it matters: The International Energy Agency projects that AI will consume increasing amounts of energy, and thus produce more greenhouse-gas emissions, as companies focus on training and serving ever larger models. Current AI poses a double-barreled challenge: The more accurate a model’s output, (i) the more emissions it will produce and (ii) the more people will query it. Much of the thinking about how to manage this issue has pointed to leaner parameter counts: Smaller models consume less energy"
