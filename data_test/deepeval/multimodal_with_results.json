Populist anger against AI raises the risk that laws will be passed that hamper AI development. To be clear, all of us working in AI should look carefully at both the benefits and harmful effects of AI (such as deepfakes polluting social media and biased or inaccurate AI outputs misleading users), speak truthfully about both benefits and harms, and work to ameliorate problems even as we work to grow the benefits. But hype about AI’s danger has done real damage to trust in our field. Much of this hype has come from leading AI companies that aim to make their technology seem extraordinarily powerful by, say, comparing it to nuclear weapons. Unfortunately, a significant fraction of the public has taken this seriously and thinks AI could bring about the end of the world. The AI community has to stop self-inflicting these wounds and work to win back society’s trust",
      ". Living in Silicon Valley, I realize I live in a bubble of AI enthusiasts, which is great for exchanging ideas and encouraging each other to build! At the same time, I recognize that AI does have problems, and the AI community needs to address them. I frequently speak with people from many different walks of life. I’ve spoken with artists concerned about AI devaluing their work, college seniors worried about the tough job market and whether AI is exacerbating their challenges, and parents worried about their kids being addicted to, and receiving harmful advice from, chatbots. I don’t know how to solve all of these problems, but I will work hard to solve as many as I can. And I hope you will too. It will only be through all of us doing this that we can win back society’s trust. Keep building! Andrew"

In addition to Claude Code, the hackers used common open-source tools, Anthropic said. Yet defenses against these familiar tools are also familiar to security experts, and it’s not clear how Claude Code would have changed this. Anthropic itself pointed out that Claude Code may well have hallucinated the information it purportedly hacked, since it “frequently overstated findings” and “occasionally fabricated data.” Such misbehavior is a significant barrier to using the system to execute cyberattacks, the company said",
      ". Security researchers are right to explore agentic AI both to perpetrate and defend against security threats, but it has not yet been found to pose the dire threat that Anthropic warns of. We’re thinking: AI companies want to promote the power of their products, and sometimes — paradoxically — that promotion emphasizes a product’s powerful contribution to a negative outcome. Positive or negative, hype is harmful. We hope that makers of state-of-the-art models and applications based on them will find ways to drum up interest in their accomplishments — many of which are genuinely impressive and exciting! — without misleading or confusing the public. With respect to cybersecurity, AI-driven detection of security flaws makes it easier to patch them.

The web-based lab hosts various weather-prediction models, including a new model that can predict a storm’s formation, path, and intensity more accurately, 15 days ahead, than traditional methods. Key insight: Models of complicated systems like weather must account for two types of randomness: (i) randomness that a model could have learned to predict with better data or training and (ii) randomness the model could not have learned, regardless of data or training methods. To address the first type, you can train an ensemble of models. To address the second, you can add randomness at inference",

Given a text instruction and camera image, the model learned to generate tokens that represented, in this order, (i) a depth map, (ii) a visual path, and (iii) changes in joint positions. To improve the system’s vision-language understanding, they further pretrained both models on 2 million examples of images and text scraped from the web. The authors fine-tuned the models to generate the next token in more than 2 million examples, which they collected themselves, of robots performing various tasks from start to finish. The examples included various combinations of text instructions, camera views, changes in joint positions, depth maps, and motion paths. At inference, users can see the next motion path before the robot moves and revise it by redrawing it via a tablet. This capability makes the robot’s actions interpretable and enables users to address potential errors before they happen",
      ". The authors started with 24.3 million robot demonstrations of tasks such as “pick up the water bottle from the drawer and put it on the desk.” Each example included a text instruction, camera views, and changes in joint positions. The authors augmented the examples with depth maps and motion paths.They generated the depth maps using a pretrained Depth Anything 2 , and they produced visual paths by tracking the robot arm’s gripper in the camera images using Molmo , a pretrained vision-language model. They trained Qwen2.5-7B on the augmented dataset.
